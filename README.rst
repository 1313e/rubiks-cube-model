Rubik's Cube Model
==================
This repo contains the C-library that I wrote during my ADACS internship in 2021.
It implements a small Rubik's cube model that is used for the `PUMAS muon transport engine`_.
PUMAS is used for mapping out the flux of muons detected in the Stawell gold mine in Victoria, Australia.

Installation
------------
This library can be easily built with the `Makefile` by simply using `make` in the root directory.
